# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and it achieves accurate digit classification.


## Features

- Preprocessing: Includes preprocessing steps such as image normalization, resizing, and grayscale conversion.
- Model Architecture: Utilizes a CNN architecture consisting of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.
- Training and Evaluation: Provides scripts for training the model on the MNIST dataset and evaluating its performance using various metrics.
- Prediction: Allows users to input handwritten digit images and obtain predictions from the trained model.



## Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kacrhub/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
```

#### 2. Install dependencies:
    
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Usage

#### 1. Training:
- Download and preprocess the MNIST dataset (if not already included).
- Run the training script to train the model:

```javascript
python train.py
```

#### 2. Test:
- Test the model's performance using the evaluation script:

```javascript
python test.py
```

#### 3. Prediction:
- Use the trained model for handwritten digit recognition:

```javascript
python main.py
```
